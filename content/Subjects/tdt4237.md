# Intro
These are my notes for TDT4237. These are my own understandings of the subject and it may not be completely correct or accurate. It is also written in slightly below average Norwegian English.

## Why do I post them here?
There is a couple of reasons. The first is for convenience. I like to write Markdown as it is very easy to structure text easily and it does not take any focus away from the text, it also has great readability both uncompiled and compiled. It is also very practical to have this available on the web as i like to read my notes on my iPad, and it is faster to access here. The last reason is that someone may find them useful.
