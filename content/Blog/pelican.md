Summary: Creating a blog with pelican

Today i was sick and i found pelican.

Pelican is a static webpage/blog generator written in python. This means that it is very safe, scalable and does not need anything special on the webserver to run.

The point of this blog is use it post stuff as documentation, and since that will probably dont happen i will not update it or post anything.
