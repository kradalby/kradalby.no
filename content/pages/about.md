Summary: About me and the purpose of this blog

## Me

My name is Kristoffer Dalby, i was born in 1992, from Sandefjord and currently living in Trondheim.
I study informatics at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology).
In my spear time, i play sysadmin in the System development and administration committee, which is a part of the Student organisation Online. I am also responsible for the committees economy.

I also am actively involved in a number of LAN-parties. I am currently the leader of dfekt LAN in Sandefjord and volunteering at The Gathering in Hamar.

## The blog
My main intention of this blog is to use the posts as documentation for my projects, documentation is something i am not really into, and i though that this approach may help, since most of my knowledge is based on blogposts from people who do the same.
