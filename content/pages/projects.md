Summary: My projects

<div class="project" markdown="1">

## kradalby.no
I created kradalby.no to have somewhere to keep the documentation i write and to have it available in a practicle manner. I use a static site generator called pelican. The stylesheet is written using less and is compiled to minified CSS when i build the site. Pelican allows me to write all the pages/posts in Markdown, which is quite pleasant.

The website is used as the main information location for every LAN party and has a complete crew management system which handles crew credit for the canteen, creating of crew badges and access control. The site also features a complete competition management and signup system. The website is built with the following technologies and frameworks:

## dfekt LAN Point of sales
![dfektlan POS](/img/dfektlanpos.png){: .img-responsive .img-project }
Together with the dfekt LAN webpage i created a Point of sales system to use in the canteen. The site is built as a AngularJS webapp that uses the Django website as its backend through a custom made API. The system also handles our crew credit system which allows our crew members to buy items from the canteen with their RFID badge.
