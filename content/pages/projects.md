Summary: My projects

## kradalby.no
I created kradalby.no to have somewhere to keep the documentation i write and to have it available in a practicle manner. I use a static site generator called pelican. The stylesheet is written using less and is compiled to minified CSS when i build the site. Pelican allows me to write all the pages/posts in Markdown, which is quite pleasant.
