Summary: Nifty utility for removing old graphic drivers

[TOC]

When i was on Dreamhack last weekend, i had to reinstall the drivers for my ATI R9 280X as Windows 10 and ATI graphics cards are not exactly stable together. I was suprised to see that the official uninstallers does not remove everything that is actually needed to properly uninstall the drivers and controll panel.

But after a little bit of googling, i found DDU [Display Driver Uninstaller](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/DDU/ddudownload.htm) which makes this process quite easy. It supports from XP to 10, and i will probably use this the next time the need arises.
